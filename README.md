# üê¨ Building event-driven systems with Kafka and ElysiaJS

_‚ö†Ô∏è This repository was created with the idea to practice using Kafka._

## Problem

Every time a financial transaction is created it must be validated by our anti-fraud microservice and then the same service sends a message back to update the transaction status. For now, we have only three transaction statuses:

- pending
- approved
- rejected

Every transaction with a value greater than 1000 should be rejected.
