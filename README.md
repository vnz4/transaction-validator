# üê¨ Building event-driven systems with Kafka and ElysiaJS

_‚ö†Ô∏è This repository was created with the idea to practice using Kafka._

## Problem

Every time a financial transaction is created it must be validated by our anti-fraud microservice and then the same service sends a message back to update the transaction status. For now, we have only three transaction statuses:

- pending
- approved
- rejected

Every transaction with a value greater than **1000** should be rejected.

## Technologies Used

- **[Bun:](https://bun.sh/)** A fast JavaScript runtime that is used for running the `anti-fraud` and `transaction` services.
- **[Elysia:](https://elysiajs.com/)** A framework used for building the application's web services.
- **[Apache Kafka:](https://kafka.apache.org/)** The event streaming platform used to handle messaging between services.
- **[Drizzle:](https://orm.drizzle.team/)** An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool used for interacting with the database.
- **[PostgreSQL:](https://www.postgresql.org/)** The relational database used for storing transaction data.

## How to run
